## Input Data.
Because of the large size of videos, the data folder is ignored.
Moreover, the input videos are adressed in param for functions.

But we choose those conventions for naming input data :
* data/
  * calibration/
    * cal_1.avi (0:16 - 65.9Mo)
    * cal_2.avi (0:17 - 69.8Mo)
    * cal_3.avi (0:36 - 142.6Mo)
  * maquette/
    * new.avi (0:44 - 166.3Mo)
